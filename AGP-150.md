# AGP-150: Aragon Black: Curve Labs
### A dedicated team for research, design, and user on-boarding for Continuous Organizations on the Aragon Network. 

## TL;DR: the Aragon Fundraising story


### Product: Aragon Fundraising app

- bonding curves unlock a financial paradigm shift
- Aragon DAOs allow project governance & capital management post-fundraising
- significant interest from early adopters

### Product Market Fit: Cultivate best practices & iterate on user feedback

- talk to users to identify pain points and improve UI/UX
- identify legal frameworks and jurisdictions that are favorable for autonomous organizations
- pilot program with high impact projects to build user profiles and lay the foundation for more users in the same target market

### Growth: next-gen DeFi platform on Aragon

- widen the total addressable market through tested templates, compliant PoCs and DAICO business models
- experiment with novel uses of curve bonding as cryptoeconomic primitive and establish valuation models around its implementation
- establishing communication channels to engage target markets
- hosting economic productivity in Aragon orgs & facilitating value flow to ANT

## Overview

Curve bonding holds great promise to facilitate a transition in finance by **democratizing price discovery** and liquidity. [Aragon Fundraising](https://github.com/AragonBlack/fundraising) in particular has high potential to attract users in the short-run and [drive ANT's value](https://observablehq.com/@lkngtn/ant-and-aragon-fundraising) as well as [providing a crucial mechanism towards meaningful DAO and bonding curves usage and application development](https://blog.aragon.org/introducing-aragon-fundraising/). Anyone anywhere with an internet connected device can create their own market. Not only that, but anyone anywhere can raise funds to support their decentralized organizations. This extends the dream of Aragon outlined in [AGP-0](https://blog.aragon.org/the-aragon-manifesto-4a21212eac03/). Discussions with early beta testers indicates significant interest  [(with >125 Fundraising testnet DAOs in 2 weeks)](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x5671d4815a2a5cfbf541496406460bf56dff2a01), however interest is not sufficient.

The complexity and vastness of the design-space can be difficult to navigate for early adopters of this primitive. In order for Aragon Fundraising to help realize Aragon's dreams the UI, UX, and onboarding experience for Aragon Fundraising needs to be improved. In that direction our short term plan involves:
* talking to users and providing them with support
* improving the onboarding and user experience based on user research
* establishing best-practices, generating useful and repeatable design patterns
* establishing and exploring legally compliant PoCs to set precedent and widen the target market beyond crypto-projects

These will make Aragon Fundraising accessible and easy to use for a wide audience while resulting in active DAOs that boost Aragon's adoption and impact. This audience may include, but not be limited to, institutional investors, activists, and native DAICO applications.

We will subsequently focus our attention on the most promising target markets. This will involve informing the design of future platforms around Aragon Fundraising that makes the product easily accessible to a wide audience. This will bring capital and users to the Aragon platform in a way that is independent of the Aragon Association or Aragon treasury funds. These users will not only use Aragon DAOs to manage their organizations post fundraising, but will also consume services such as the Aragon Court and Aragon Chain (whose ANJ and ARA tokens are themselves generated by staking ANT via the Fundraising app).

*In the long-run Curve Labs is aiming for the  **self-sustainability** of the on-boarding initiative by testing multiple approaches during the grant period such as incubation (token allocation for incubation) & curve bonded onboarding models (bids on a curation continuous organization to attain onboarding status).*



## Scope of Work

While we have ambitious plans for the future, we also need to think practically. As such we are focusing in the incubation strategy for on-boarding, high impact pilot programs, and route to legal compliance.

### I01 Improve AF On-boarding

#### Background: 

The Fundraising app will soon be coming to Ethereum Mainnet. From preliminary market research we expect significant demand from users. At the moment, however, it is non-trivial to understand and set up a Fundraising Campaign on Aragon with AF. This is due to the novelty of bonding curves, the underlying governance model, and UX challenges around using the product.

As we launch we would like to provide users with ongoing support in order to collect feedback on the product. First, this will convert more interested users into actual users, realizing the value of our early marketing efforts and reducing churn. Second, this will inform the design of future iterations of AF as well as supplemental services such as a discovery platform for projects using AF. Third, this will allow us to develop user profiles for high leverage target markets. This will allow us to determine the initial target market for AF and in order to focus our later efforts towards those users.

#### Deliverables: 

- conduct user research to identify on-boarding frictions and improve our conversion funnel
- create AF support channels 
- design and communicate best practices around using AF
- improve the existing AF documentation with video tutorials and in depth articles
- continue and improve meetups and workshops around AF
- propose and implement design alterations on curve initialization and fundraising interface


### I02 High Impact Projects

#### Background

We have conducted initial market research via an AF early adopter sign-up form. We have received upwards of 50 applications, and from these, have followed up with a handful of promising projects. Our findings indicate that despite an appetite for DAICOs on Aragon, projects require intensive support to get started. We have performed an initial analysis of these early adopters and identified a few promising projects that we would like to move forward with. There are real world high impact use cases that we feel would show the utility of DAICOs to large and under served markets. 

#### Deliverables

- onboard 3 projects that are representative of a high impact user profile
- incorporate feedback from these projects to optimize the AF product and onboarding process
- document onboarding and user guides for similar organizations to onboard themselves to AF
- (if necessary) develop custom DAICO DAO templates that synergize with current Arargon apps to support high-impact use cases

### I03 Legally Compliant DAICOs

#### Background

For AF to receive mainstream and institutional adoption it needs to be legally compliant. We will work with legal scholars & professionals to understand the requirements for setting a framework of compliant AF implementations in major jurisdictions. We will continue to take part in MIT Media Labs' Automated Autonomous Legal Entities Working Group and emerge fact patterns on DAICOs.

#### Deliverables

- identify key interactions for users and investors of AF DAICOs
- identify jurisdictions that could provide an initial target market to launch AF in a legally compliant way
- create a proof of concept that provides a path for legally compliant implementations of AF
- establish fact patterns on DAICOs with AALE WG



## Project profiles

This section presents a non-exhaustive list of target profiles for our on-boarded projects. Based on current applications and extensive discussion we believe we can achieve product market fit and boost Aragon's adoption by first demonstrating Fundraising's utility on crypto native use cases while creating prototypes for institutional adoption

**Target profiles**

* Self-organizing network using AF as a community alignment tool
* OS project funding its needs through AF
* Impact organization proof of concept with AF
* Radical markets applications
* Legally compliant Fundraising DAO proof of concept
* Anonymous DAICOs
* Stablecoin variations
* DAICOs which "physical world" revenue to curve buy-back mechanisms

 **Frequency**

The proposal is for a reccuring quarterly payment that can be amended in future ANVs.
