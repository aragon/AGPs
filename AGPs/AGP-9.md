## Description of desired Association policy change

The Aragon Association shall not endorse or celebrate any religion or religious holiday, or nation or national holiday, other than official Aragon holidays.

## Motivation for changing this Association policy

Through the @AragonProject Twitter account the Aragon Association recently wished followers a ["Merry Christmas"](https://twitter.com/AragonProject/status/1077478103478358018). While there's nothing wrong with this good will _per se_, noticeably absent are wishes of a _Happy Hanukkah_, _Ramadan Kareem_, or other well wishes for followers of other religious holidays. 

Rather than attempt to appease all of the followers of the many religions or nationalities by celebrating the hundreds of related holidays, the Aragon Association should remain neutral to these events, instead only endorsing and celebrating official Aragon holidays that have been approved through the AGP process.
