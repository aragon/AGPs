## Description of desired Association policy change

The Aragon Association will close its accounts on all Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL, GOOG) or Alphabet Inc.-operated (e.g. Google) services by July 1, 2019 and require all Flock teams to do the same. Any Flock teams that still have accounts on Alphabet Inc. or Alphabet Inc.-operated services after July 1, 2019 will not be eligible for funding from the Aragon Association or the Aragon Network. The Aragon Association and Aragon Flock teams will also not purchase any hardware sold by Alphabet Inc. or Alphabet Inc.-operated services.

## Motivation for changing this Association policy

Aragon Association board member Jorge Izquierdo [recently disclosed](https://twitter.com/izqui9/status/1070222890321281024) that the Aragon Association runs its Ethereum nodes in Google Cloud. It is well known by now that Google uses mass surveillance of their users and users of their users (e.g. Google Analytics) both for their own benefit and the benefit of various [government agencies](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-infiltrates-links-to-yahoo-google-data-centers-worldwide-snowden-documents-say/2013/10/30/e51d661e-4166-11e3-8b74-d89d714ca4dd_story.html). 

The surveillance activity of Alphabet Inc. and its associated companies is problematic for a number of reasons and directly contradicts the values put forth in AGP-0, the Aragon Manifesto:

> The Internet has opened the doors for universal, cross-border, and non-violent collaborative effort to fight for our freedom.
> 
> However, the Internet has also opened the doors for global surveillance and manipulation.
> 
> We believe humankind should use technology as a liberating tool to unleash all the goodwill and creativity of our species, rather than as a tool to enslave and take advantage of one another.
> 
> Thus, Aragon is a fight for freedom. Aragon empowers freedom by creating liberating tools that leverage decentralized technologies.

The Aragon Association has an opportunity to directly contribute to a world where technology is not used "for global surveillance" by moving its services away from a company that has built one of the largest surveillance systems in the world. The purpose of this AGP is to make that opportunity explicit and to urge the Aragon Association to lead by example and leave Alphabet Inc. behind sooner rather than later.
