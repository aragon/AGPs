# Association ANT Budget

## Description of desired Association policy change

This proposal would create a quarterly ANT budget that cannot exceed 5% of the Aragon treasury ANT balance. Here "Aragon treasury ANT balance" is defined as the ANT balance per the Aragon multi-sig, net of any unpaid ANT liabilities at the end of each quarter (31st March, 31st June, 31st Sept, 31st Dec). 

## Motivation for changing this Association policy

**TL;DR:**

- ANT should be treated as a store of value, more like equity in a company that incentivizes long-term thinking.
- To ensure that we have enough ANT to reward Aragon Network community members long into the future we propose to put a cap on the amount of ANT that can be distributed each quarter by the Association.

**Overview:**

If we want people to act like founders, we need to treat them like founders. To make this happen we need to make a clear distinction between ANT (whose value is primarily related to governance) and every other asset in our vault (whose value is primarily financial). Whether you're a startup or a listed entity with liquid stocks, the company shares don't form part of the quarterly budget.

Since the primary value of ANT is governance we need to ensure that the Aragon Network has a diverse group of token holders. A separate budget for ANT will help the network be more strategic about issuing ANT to stakeholders that may be currently under-represented. This will encourage ongoing participation in Aragon governance as the network grows. 

Moreover, many of the approved AGPs are comprised of both DAI payments and ANT payments. Having a dedicated ANT budget will help ensure that there is adequate ANT available to cover ANT liabilities from previous or new AGPs.
