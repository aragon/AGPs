AGP: X
Title: Treasury Stabilization

## Motivation
The Aragon Association currently holds most of its assets in ETH, a volatile cryptocurrency. At the time of writing this AGP, the price of ETH is higher than the price at the time of the crowdsale, but this is not guaranteed to always be the case. The Aragon Association should take action to secure the stability of its treasury to ensure the long-term health of the Aragon project.

## Proposal
If this AGP is approved, the Aragon Association will commit to selling no less than 50% of the ETH it holds in exchange for relatively stable assets by January 1, 2020 at 00:00 UTC. The Association will have a preference for DAI, because it is a crypto-native stable asset closely aligned with the values of the Aragon project, but other relatively stable assets such as CHF, EUR, and USD will also be acceptable should there be a shortage of DAI liquidity in the market at the time exchanges are planned. The Aragon Association will make its best effort to get the most favorable exchange rate possible i.e. to receive the largest amount of stable assets in exchange for its ETH as is possible at the time the exchanges are made, and will provide a complete accounting of each exchange to ANT holders within six (6) months of the exchange.
