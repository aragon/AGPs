## Purpose of the transfer

For services rendered as the Aragon Network Security Partner. 

ConsenSys Diligence (CD) would like to propose a hybrid model, establish a more comprehensive, continuous and collaborative approach to securing the Aragon Network. 

Our proposal includes two facets: 

#### 1. Ongoing security advisory

CD will provide 2 security engineers for ongoing services, as primary and secondary points of contact. We would be available to provide support in
* architectural decisions
* upgrade paths
* continuous integration of security tools
* review security related pull requests
* ensure preparedness for audits

This ongoing relationship will reduce cost, and risk of rework when audits are performed. 

Importantly, the scope of this effort may also include web application security review. Although the greatest risk is of smart contract vulnerabilities; the security of the web-interface is crucial to protect users, their private keys, and the wallet funds their keys will vote to direct.

The method of delivery would be two 1-hour calls per month, and ongoing discussion via email, github, and chat (such as keybase)

**Response Time (upper limit):** 2 business days
**Monthly hours:** 20 hours


#### 2. Auditing

Up to once per quarter, when the Aragon team has a significant set of changes which they wish to have audited, we will perform the work for 50% of the standard price based on the size and complexity of the changes. 

Recognizing that prices are subjective and highly varied, we commit to a good faith cost estimation based on recent similar work. If Aragon disagrees with our our pricing, we will encourage Aragon to seek alternative estimates which we will consider in our assessments. 

We recognize that the market has changed since our previous audits; quoted prices will reflect that.

**Work sample:** We have previously done [two](https://github.com/ConsenSys/0x-review) [major](https://github.com/ConsenSys/0x_audit_report_2018-07-23) audits for 0xProject. Recently we worked with them on a new basis, performing an [incremental audit](https://github.com/ConsenSys/0x-audit-report-2018-12) on a smaller upgrade. 

**Note:** Our preference would be to assign auditors who are NOT working with the Aragon team as part of the Ongoing Security Advisory service above. An adversarial mindset is essential to auditing, and regular collaboration can lead to an auditor "buying in" to the way new code is being developed, preventing them from seeing new issues as they emerge. 


## Amount of the transfer

For ongoing services: The equivalent of $12,000 per month in either ANT or DAI.

For audits up to once per quarter: 60% of our standard pricing based on size and complexity.


## Number and frequency of transfers if recurring (enter “1” if only one payment will be made)

3 Monthly transfers at the beginning of February, March, and April 2018.

If an audit is performed during this period, we will propose payment for the agreed price in the April voting period.
