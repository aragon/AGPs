# AGP-131: Aragon Association acquisition of ANJ for security purposes

## Address of the transfer recipient

`aragonproject.eth`

## Amount of the transfer

1,000,000 ANT

## Number and frequency of transfers if recurring (enter “1” if only one payment will be made)

1

## Purpose of the transfer

With the imminent launch of the Aragon Court, there may be 51% attacks to the Court itself, which could put the whole Court in jeopardy.

In order to prevent that, we want to propose the Aragon Association to acquire ANJ and hold it over the course of the first few months that the Aragon Court will be operating, until it’s proven and seamlessly working. It would work this way:

- The Aragon Association would participate on the ANJ sale like any other participant and purchase 1m ANT worth of ANJ
- The acquired ANJ would be stored in the Aragon multisig, controlled by the Aragon Association Board of Directors
- The acquired ANJ would be gradually sold for ANT and transferred back into the project’s multisig at a rate of 1/6 per month
- The acquired ANJ would only be used under force majeure circumstances that would impede Aragon Court from working correctly
