# Implement an independent Aragon Council

## Motivation for making this change

Independent councils help companies navigate important, high-level, and often difficult decisions absent of any conflicts of interest. The Aragon Network budget is one of those things.  Inspired by Melonport's "Melon Council", it is envisaged that the Aragon Council would be comprised of independent individuals that have: 

- substantial experience in the financial management of technology-centric organisations
- a declared absence of any conflict of interest with Aragon or the AGP grant allocation process
- a willingness and ability to dedicate time and resources to Aragon
- evidenced high ethical standards, good reputation and signed an advisory agreement to confirm compliance with the Aragon Manifesto.
- preferably invested in ANT with "skin in the game"

Initial council members will be selected by the Aragon Association, but it is expected that in the future council members will be added or removed via ANT votes. 

The main role of the Aragon Council would be to agree on a suitable amount of spending per quarter.  The Aragon Council would also provide suggestions on how to deploy capital across different expenditure categories in a given quarter.  They will rely on their business experience to evaluate what a) an absolute quarterly spending figure should be and b) an expenditure category allocation. It's a relatively simple job and one that VCs and board members are used to do doing. All budgetary allocation decisions made by the Aragon Council would be made in real-time using a dedicated Aragon DAO. It should be noted that this proposal merely gives the Aragon Council authority to set the quarterly budget and no other executive responsibility.

Capital would continue to be distributed to teams using the current AGP process. The new change would be that each AGP would be need to be categorized into an expenditure category (ex: Category A = Development). This would provide additional guardrails on the Aragon Network budget to ensure that appropriate resources are allocated to each expenditure category in a clear and organized way. Initial expenditure categories would include, but not be limited to:

- Development
- Research
- Security
- Legal
- Accounting & Banking
- Market Making 
- Treasury Management
- Customer Support
- Marketing
- Sales and business development
- Operations
- Community Management 
- Events
- Miscellaneous

Teams applying for funding through the AGP process would need to provide a detailed financial breakdown of how they intend to spend funds and detail spending per category. Should the expenditure sum of approved AGPs expenditure in a given category exceed the allocated budget for that category, ANT holders shall use the DOT voting app to pro-rate capital allocation between AGPs in that category.
