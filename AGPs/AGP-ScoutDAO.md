# AGP-X: ScoutDAO

## Address of the transfer recipient

ScoutDAO (DAO vault address)

## Amount of the transfer

250k DAI

## Number and frequency of transfers if recurring (enter “1” if only one payment will be made)

1, but maybe more

## Purpose of the transfer

Fund ScoutDAO operations.

### The Problem / Background

What’s the problem(s) with Nest DAO? 
- Not enough deals are coming in
- Interests are not aligned
  - None of the members are being paid to due diligence deals
  - None of the members are being paid if the projects they evaluate succeed 
- Nest DAO is operating more like an angel/seed fund, investing 50k-150k. But there is a funding gap at the family & friends / angel stage. Super early projects are not getting funded, and as a result, are not applying for funding. This is hampering innovation in the Argaon network.
- The result? 
  - Very Low deal flow volume.
  - Poor due diligence 
  - Long decision making times  

### The Solution / Future
 
ScoutDAO 
- What is it? 
  - An Aragon DAO dedicated towards sourcing and funding deals that are too early for NestDAO.
  - Acts as a deal generator for NestDAO
- Why will it solve the problem for NestDAO? 
  - Higher quality deal flow
  - More deal flow
  - Greater liklihood of shipping production ready products
- Why will this benefit Aragon as a platform?
  - More developers building on Aragon
  - More projects shipping from NestDAO 
  - Cheaper and faster than monolithic Flock proposals
