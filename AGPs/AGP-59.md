# AGP-59: Community Review Period

## File changed (AGP-0 or AGP-1)

AGP-1

## Link to proposed change

https://github.com/aragon/AGPs/pull/58

## Motivation for making this change

Experience after the first two Aragon Network votes under the AGP-1 process indicates that AGP authors have a propensity to submit their proposals close to the submission deadline, giving little time for the community to give feedback and attempt to influence the final wording of proposals. This proposal attempts to address this issue head on by creating a mandatory community review period during which AGP authors and reviewers can dialogue in an attempt to improve the wording of open proposals and increase their likelihood of ultimately being approved by ANT voters.
