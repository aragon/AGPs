# AGP-X: Oppose any change to Ethereum's mining algorithm before Ethereum 2.0

## Proclamation text

ANT holders who vote "yes" on this proposal oppose Ethereum changing its proof-of-work mining algorithm before the switch to proof-of-stake as part of the Ethereum 2.0 roll-out, unless such change is intended as an "emergency fix" to a fatal flaw in the current mining algorithm. A "fatal flaw" is defined here as a flaw that breaks the expected functionality of Ethereum (e.g. if blocks are consistently mined too quickly or too slowly, or if blocks could be mined by some miners faster than others despite having equal hashpower) or causes Ethereum to completely stop working (i.e. stop producing blocks and confirming valid transactions).

This AGP includes opposition to the "[tenatively accepted](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1679.md#tentatively-accepted-eips)" [EIP-1057: ProgPoW, a Programmatic Proof-of-Work](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1057), and any other proposed changes to Ethereum's proof-of-work mining algorithm that don't fit reasonable criteria of an "emergency fix" as described above.

## Motivation for writing this proclamation

Ethereum is currently working as expected, and so the proposal author sees no reason to change the mining algorithm now or at any time in the foreseeable future before the switch to Ethereum 2.0 proof-of-stake.
