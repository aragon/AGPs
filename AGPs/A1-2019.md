# Aragon Flock proposal: Aragon One

## Address of the transfer recipient
Funds will be managed by the Aragon One DAO ([`a1.aragonid.eth`](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/a1.aragonid.eth/)) on the Ethereum Mainnet.

Its Finance app address is `0x38da6AC44200551b75e20451F2e6d9f7175086B5`. In order to deposit, please use the deposit function in Aragon, and **do not send tokens directly** to that address.

## Amount of the transfer
- $4m in DAI (or other stable assets, such as fiat)
- 1,675,000 ANT

## Number and frequency of transfers
- The $4m payment is one-off
- The 1,675,000 ANT will vest over the next 4 years
  - Due to existing ANT commitments with employees, we request the cliff to happen in ~9 months instead of 12 months. This would be on October 1st, 2019
  - For the remaining 3 years of vesting, the remaining 75% of the tokens will be freed at 25% per year
  - 100% of the tokens would be freed on October 1st, 2022
