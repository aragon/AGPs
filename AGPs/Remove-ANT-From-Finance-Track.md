# Remove ANT from the Aragon Network finance track

## Motivation for making this change

**TL;DR:**

- ANT is not money, so we should remove ANT from the calculation of the AGP Finance-track Aragon Network Budget.
- A separate ANT budget should be dedicated to ANT. ANT should be treated as a store of value, more like equity in a company that incentivizes long-term thinking.

**Overview**

If we want people to act like founders, we need to treat them like founders. To make this happen we need to make a clear distinction between ANT (whose value is primarily related to governance) and every other asset in our vault (whose value is primarily financial). Whether you're a startup or a listed entity with liquid stocks, the company shares don't form part of the quarterly budget.

Since the primary value of ANT is governance we need to ensure that the Aragon Network has a diverse group of token holders. A separate budget for ANT will help the network be more strategic about issuing ANT to stakeholders that may be currently under-represented. This will encourage ongoing participation in Aragon governance as the network grows. 

Moreover, many of the approved AGPs are comprised of both DAI payments and ANT payments. Having a dedicated ANT budget will help ensure that there is adequate ANT available to cover ANT liabilities from previous or new AGPs.
