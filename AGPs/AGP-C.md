# Support Locked Voting

## Proclamation text

ANT holders who vote to approve this proposal support a change to the AGP process that implements Locked Voting. The Locked Voting feature would require that ANT holders must have their ANT locked in a smart contract for a period of time at the start of an Aragon Network vote in order for them to be able to vote. The period of time that ANT must be locked for in order to be eligible to vote will be specified in a future AGP to formally adopt Locked Voting if this AGP is approved.

## Motivation for writing this proclamation

There has been concern expressed that someone with less than good intentions for the Aragon project may purchase a sizeable enough amount of ANT before a vote to be able to swing the vote and approve proposals that they support but that may be harmful to the project. By requiring ANT holders to lock their ANT to be qualified to vote, we ensure that voters are exposed to the near-term consequences of their voting decisions, and that voters are committed to supporting the project by locking their ANT for some time after participating in a vote.

This proposal does not implement Locked Voting but is intended to gauge and signal the level of support for Locked Voting by ANT holders. If this proposal is approved, it will show ANT holder support for investing additional resources into researching and developing the changes necessary to implement Locked Voting in Aragon. Once the Locked Voting feature is fully developed, another AGP will be submitted to modify AGP-1 and the `governance.aragonproject.eth` organization to adopt the feature.
