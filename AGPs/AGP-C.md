# Support Locked Voting

## Proclamation text

ANT holders who vote to approve this proposal support a change to the AGP process that implements Locked Voting. The Locked Voting feature would require that ANT holders must have their ANT locked in a smart contract for at least one year at the start of an Aragon Network vote in order for them to be able to vote.

## Motivation for writing this proclamation

There has been concern expressed that someone with less than good intentions for the Aragon project may purchase a sizeable enough amount of ANT before a vote to be able to swing the vote and approve proposals that they support but that may be harmful to the project. By requiring ANT holders to lock their ANT for a period of at least one year to be qualified to vote, we ensure that voters are exposed to the near-term consequences of their voting decisions, and that voters are committed to supporting the project by holding ANT for at least one year after participating in a vote.

This proposal does not implement Locked Voting but is intended to gauge and signal the level of support for Locked Voting by ANT holders. If this proposal is approved, it will provide support for investing additional resources into researching and developing the changes necessary to implement Locked Voting in Aragon. Once the Locked Voting feature is fully developed, another AGP will be submitted to modify AGP-1 and the governance.aragonproject.eth organization to adopt the feature.
