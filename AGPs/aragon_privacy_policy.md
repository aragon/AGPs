# Aragon Privacy Policy

## Description of desired Association policy change

The Aragon Association will create a privacy policy and act as data protection officer (DPO) for all data collected at the network level. This includes, but is not limited to data collected through the Aragon Client, Aragon Court, Aragon SDK, Aragon.org newsletter and Aragon help desk. Article 23 calls for controllers to hold and process only the data absolutely necessary for the completion of its duties (data minimisation), as well as limiting the access to personal data to those needing to act out the processing.

## Motivation for changing this Association policy

There are potentially very large fines for non-compliance with the [Swiss Data Protection Act](https://www.admin.ch/opc/en/classified-compilation/19920153/index.html) and [General Data Protection Regulations](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj) (GDPR). Organizations in breach of GDPR can be fined up to 4% of annual global turnover or â‚¬20 Million (whichever is greater). It is our understanding that Aragon is currently not legally compliant with either the Swiss Data Protection Act or GDPR. 

The Aragon Client and other core infrastructure components of the Aragon Network are capturing sensitive user data, some of which is stored on-chain and some off-chain. 

As the steward of the Aragon Network the Aragon Association has a duty to be the data controller for data collected by Aragon Network infrastructure.

This responsibility will eventually be spun out to independent DAOs that can synergize with other teams across the ecosystem.
